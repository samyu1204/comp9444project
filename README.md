### Reminder about checkpoints for HRFuser:

Since checkpoints pre-trained weight are huge and cannot be included in GitHub Commits: Please create a folder on root called checkpoints and download the pre-trained weight here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e0esMyGVJndVcjbwkyUo29KlyZBtnh1f

Also, HRFuser using minidataset V1, which is huge to be included, please download it from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFLqUaNF4tKNx4LDIwrkJ9W0hmKLhx5Z?usp=sharing

Remember to put data as root directory, data wll be ignored by git, please set it up so the code can run smoothly

### For 2DPASS
Our 2DPASS model trained weights are too large to push onto GIT, so we have uploaded it onto the google drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R8G0F16GPXAZKLjbiVXZpobY-xctPge2?usp=drive_link

Then drag the weights into the root of the 2DPASS folder. Also the data set will need to be downloaded from the Nuscenes website, select the lidarseg option:
https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes
Then drag this into the dataset folder.
