    "### Introduction\n",
    "Our project aims to leverage computer vision neural network to improve object detection of images during both daytime and nighttime environments. The ability to accurately detect and recognize objects in varying lighting condition has become crucial for the functionalities of many modern day applications; some examples would be autonomous vehicles, surveillance and security systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Modern day computer vision neural networks often fail to perform well in nighttime object detection (low accuracy object detection at night). Nighttime environment factors like shadow, limited luminosity, and visibility makes it challenging for the network to classify objects. With this problem, it can hinder the effectiveness and safety of pre-existing computer vision applications like surveillance, which requires 24/7 monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving day/night object detection will definitely bring significant enhancements in the real world, and some key areas of improvements are autonomous driving, surveillance and security systems. This is not only an exciting technical challenge for researchers, but also has the potential to open up new possibilities for neural network computer vision advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statements\n",
    "Key challenges that requires to be address by our models are:\n",
    "1. The model requires to handle varying levels of brightness within the image.\n",
    "2. Removing noise from nighttime image, as image taken at night might have more noise."
