    "### Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "Since 2010, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and automated driving have rapidly emerged as significant trends in the automotive industry. These developments underline the importance of achieving high-performance on-road object detection under diverse operating conditions, including nighttime and extreme weather scenarios (Waldschmidt, C., Hasch, J. and Menzel, W., 2021). Such environments present unique challenges for traditional vision-based systems, necessitating novel approaches to ensure reliable and robust object detection.\n",
    "![trends](images/motivation/trend.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern day computer vision neural networks often fail to perform well in nighttime object detection (inaccurate detection of objects in low luminosity environments). Nighttime environment factors like shadow, limited luminosity, and visibility makes it challenging for the network to classify objects. With this problem, it can hinder the effectiveness and safety of pre-existing computer vision applications like surveillance, which requires all day monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving day/night object detection will definitely bring significant enhancements in the real world, and some key areas of improvements are autonomous driving, surveillance and security systems. This is not only an exciting technical challenge for researchers, but also has the potential to open up new possibilities for neural network computer vision advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, sensor fusion technology has gained traction in addressing these challenges. The integration of various sensors such as camera, radar, and lidar, provides richer and more comprehensive data, which has been shown to enhance object detection capabilities (Nobis, F., Geisslinger, M., Weber, M., Betz, J. and Lienkamp, M., 2019). With the increasing prevalence of commercial vehicles equipped with these multiple sensor systems, sensor fusion methodologies have become an area of active research, particularly in the context of deep learning-based object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our task\n",
    "  This work aims to conduct a comparative study of state-of-the-art models based on both camera-only and sensor fusion methodologies, to understand the potential benefits of sensor fusion in improving nighttime object detection performance. Moreover, we seek to identify and evaluate the public datasets that can be utilized for future research in this domain. By elucidating the performance differences between various model architectures and data inputs, we hope to provide valuable insights for ongoing advancements in ADAS and automated driving technologies. Furthermore, by assessing the suitability of available datasets for such research, we aim to facilitate further exploration and development in this critical field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related works\n",
    "Researchers have made advancements in enhancing accuracy for low-light detection. An example is the REDI low-light enhancement algorithm, which effectively filters noise in low-light conditions and performs detection on the resulting image.\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/lowlight.png\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here (a) through to (d) are stages of REDI algorithm filtering. However, there are many downsides to this algorithm like loss of details, over-correction, and high computational cost. This would pose a challenge as it would add extra complexity and computational stress on existing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our literature review, there are two kinds of approaches for the object detection based on the input sensor: single sensor-based and multiple sensor-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single Sensor-Based Approaches\n",
    "Single sensor-based approaches have gained significant traction in object detection tasks due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. One of the representative models in this category is YOLOv3 proposed by Redmon and Farhadi (2018). This model is an incremental improvement over previous YOLO models, showcasing remarkable performance in real-time object detection tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the performance of YOLOv8 in pedestrian detection was explored by Sjöberg (2023). This study provided crucial insights into the application of single sensor-based approaches in pedestrian detection tasks, one of the most challenging scenarios in autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also noteworthy is the work of Yan et al. (2022), which introduced 2DPASS, a system that utilizes 2D priors for semantic segmentation on lidar point clouds. This method effectively leverages lidar data for object detection, further advancing the capabilities of single sensor-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Sensor-Based Approaches\n",
    "The fusion of data from multiple sensors has emerged as a promising avenue to improve object detection performance. Broedermann et al. (2023) proposed HRFuser, a multi-resolution sensor fusion architecture for 2D object detection. By leveraging different sensor data at varying resolutions, HRFuser demonstrated a remarkable ability to detect objects under diverse conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These studies collectively indicate the substantial potential of both single sensor and multiple sensor-based approaches in tackling the complexities of object detection tasks. As the evolution of sensor technologies continues, we expect further improvements in object detection performance, particularly under challenging conditions such as nighttime and extreme weather scenarios. This underscores the relevance of our current study, which aims to evaluate and compare these approaches across various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statements\n",
    "Key challenges that requires to be address by our models are:\n",
    "1. The model requires to handle varying levels of brightness within the image.\n",
    "2. Removing noise from nighttime image, as image taken at night might have more noise."

However, the data that LiDAR captures is sparse and textureless and so may benefit from additional sources of data. Cameras images are able to provide dense color information and fine grained textures but provide ambiguous depth perception and can be unclear in low light conditions such as at night. As cameras and LiDAR complement each other, 2DPASS was chosen as it uses both input modalities and we check if this provides better night time detection compared to models only using 2D images.\n",

    "Multi scale fusion to single knowledge distillation (MSFSKD) then enhances the 3D network by providing textural information and structural regularisation from the 2D network to enhance feature learning. To transfer information between the two modalities, point-to-pixel correspondence is used to create paired features of the two modalities. The 3D features are transformed using a multilayer perceptron before they are fused with their 2D counterparts and this can be used to improve the 3D network. Then features at each scale are then used to generate the semantic segmentation predictions."

    "Our experimental setup involved careful parameter tuning, meticulous selection of evaluation metrics, and strategic data splitting for training, validation, and testing. YOLOv8s was trained using SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, a batch size of 16, and an IoU threshold of 0.7. For HRFuser, due to hardware constraints, we used a batch size of 1 and made use of pre-trained weights. We also used a mini-training dataset of Nuscenes due to computational and time constraints. Lastly, 2DPASS was trained with a learning rate of 0.24, SGD optimizer, momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 1.0e-4. A batch size of 1 was adopted due to memory constraints. Evaluation metrics for all models included mAP (mean average precision) for object detection, evaluated separately for day and night conditions, and IoU (Intersection over Union) for bounding box overlap. For training and validation, we used a subset of the nuScenes dataset, ensuring a balanced representation of different classes and illumination conditions (day and night). The test set was kept separate and was not involved in any part of the model training or tuning process. Codes are as following:"

    "\n",
    "### YOLOv8s Discussion\n",
    "#### System Performance\n",
    "System Specifications: We have trained YOLOv8 model through Google Colab with NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Specifications\n",
    "Training parameter have been pre-tuned by the developer:\n",
    "- Optimizer: SGD(lr=0.01) with parameter groups 57 weight(decay=0.0), 64 weight(decay=0.001), 63 bias\n",
    "- batch: 16\n",
    "- IoU: 0.7\n",
    "And we set image size = 1280, which has a better result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Time\n",
    "The training process of YOLOv8 on the mini dataset would take 0.230 hours. When we added epoch size to 150, our model stopped training at epoch 75, since there was no improvement in the last 50 epochs.\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/yolov8_training _time.png\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "And the best result was observed at epoch 25, so we used epoch size = 25. As a result, the training time has decreased to 0.08 hours.\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/yolov8_training_time_25_epoches.png\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "The nuImages sample dataset contains approximately 40,000 images in total. But after downloading, we got around 20,000 images as training set. Using all of these images for training the model would result in excessively long training times. Apart from the provided all_sample dataset, the official source also offers a mini dataset with only 50 images. However, if we use the mini dataset to train the model, the small sample size and insufficient representation of certain categories could lead to inaccurate learning for those categories and over-fitting as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to mitigate the challenges associated with dataset size, we constructed a dataset by randomly sampling 350 images from each camera and manually adjusted the distribution of daytime and nighttime images within our mini dataset from nuImage. However, this approach may still lead to imbalanced proportions of different classes in comparison to the full dataset, potentially influencing our prediction results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HRFUser Model Discussion\n",
    "#### System Performance:\n",
    "System Specifications:\n",
    "We train this data on another machine which is a Linux-Sub-System Machine but does not have GPU onboard, the training has to be on CPU. We have to reduce the batch size and the dataset. The training would took ages for this to happen so we have to make use of pre-trained weighted\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "For the interest of time we have used the mini-training dataset of Nuscenes which is around 6 gigabytes compared to the 80 gigabytes full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Specifications\n",
    "Training batch size had to be limited to a size of 1 as any batch sizes larger than this would cause insufficient memory errors.\n",
    "As we have insufficient training resources, for this device working on this model, we have to make use of the pre-trained weight provided by the Research Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Architecture\n",
    "HRFuser is a multi-resolution sensor fusion architecture that easily scales to any number of input modalities. HRFuser is built on cutting-edge high-resolution networks for image-only dense prediction and includes a new multi-window cross-attention block to conduct fusion of many modalities at multiple resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Time\n",
    "It would take ages, approximately more than 8 hours on the device working on this. But to use pre-trained weight, it would cost us approximately an hour to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/train_time_HR_Fuser.png\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "The challenge for this model is that it makes use of the mmdet library and mmcv but the running environment on the paper provided is only suitable with a Linux running environment. We would have to create a WSL ( Window Subsystem for Linux) and then run the project on it. Also, WSL cannot connect and refer directly with the Window's CUDA and GPU, we have to modify the code for it to accept CPU train on Pytorch. As CPU train is very limited, we have to fully reduced the batch size to 1 and then perform training on a small MiniDataset instead of a huge one. Also, making use of a pre-trained weight would save us much time rather than training the whole process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall HRuser actually better the performance on low-light detection since it was able to fuse all the data input such as camera and sensors together for the train. Thus, improve significantly the detection on varies foggy and low-light environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2DPASS Discussion\n",
    "#### System Performance:\n",
    "System Specifications:\n",
    "We have trained the 2DPASS model on a Nvidia 4060 laptop graphics card with 16 gigabytes of RAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "For the interest of time we have used the mini-training dataset of nuscenes which is around 6 gigabytes compared to the 80 gigabytes full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Specifications\n",
    "Training batch size had to be limited to a size of 1 as any batch sizes larger than this would cause insufficient memory errors.\n",
    "Training parameters have been pre-tuned by the developers as:\n",
    "- Learning Rate: 0.24\n",
    "- Optimizer: SGD\n",
    "- Momentum: 0.9\n",
    "- Weight Decay: 1.0e-4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Architecture\n",
    "This model significantly improves upon simple image computer vision neural networks, as 2DPASS introduces lidar detection combined with the use of image. This more accurately detects the existence and classification of the object even in low luminosity environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Time\n",
    "The training process of our model on the mini-dataset took approximately 5 hours, which is due to our computer’s limited memory as it was only able to manage a batch training size of one. Also, due to the limited variety in the mini-dataset, we observed that the val/mIoU failed to show improvements over the last 50 records, which shows that a lot of the computation towards the end of training did not achieve any notable performance improvements.\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/train_time.png\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "Originally running the model on the whole 80 gigabytes data requires too much computational power and time, so we resorted to using the mini-training set instead, which was much faster to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training on a much smaller dataset could potentially introduce overfitting of data and lead to inaccurate results, in this case we have used their pre-trained model to compare results before drawing conclusions.\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/overfit.png\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "The above is the result from testing the model trained with the mini-dataset, and here we can clearly see a case of overfitting where all vehicle like objects are recognised as cars explaining the high accuracy in car predictions and basically 0% accuracy in all other vehicles detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main challenges occurred within our limited ability to modify the model, as the training time even on a much smaller dataset took up to five hours. To tackle this problem, we have introduced early-stopping of the training, where if we do not see noticeable improvements on the mIoU(mean intersection over Union) value over five epochs of training we will manually exit the training. However, finding a sweet spot for the improvement was difficult and is hard to optimise. Moreover, as training is also dependent on the distribution of the dataset, it is uncertain how much the model will learn from processing different data.\n",
